# YouTube Music Playlist to CSV

YouTube Music does not have a playlist export feature, incomprehensibly.

To help mitigate this situation, here is a stopgap solution that doesn't require you to give anyone access to your account.

Steps:

- Open your playlist and scroll all the way to the bottom. Select all. Paste into Notepad. 
- Trim stuff that isn't song data at the top and bottom of the file.
- Save the file as a .txt file.
- Run this script from the folder where your files are located.

Output: A CSV with Title, Artist, Album, and Time
